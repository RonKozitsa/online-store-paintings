      <p>
        Creativity was always a big part of my life, it is in my genes and a part of who I am.
        I have always looked at the world as a place full of colors and opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day when I was 15 years old, my mom brought home some painting equipment, and when I saw all these colors, a deep desire that I had pushed away for many years rose and all I wanted was to try out all the different colors.<br />
        Since that day I havenâ€™t stopped painting.
